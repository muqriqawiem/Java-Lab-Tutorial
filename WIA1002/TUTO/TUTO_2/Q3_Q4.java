        Question 3:
        - A raw type is when u use a generic type without specifying an actual parameter
        - A raw type is unsafe because some errors cannot be detected by the compiler
        - Raw type is allowed in Java for better compatibility.
        
        Question 4:
        - Generic type information is used by the compiler to check whether the type is used safely.
          Afterwards the type information is erased. The type information is not available at runtime. This
          approach enables the generic code to be backward-compatible with the legacy code that uses raw
          types.
